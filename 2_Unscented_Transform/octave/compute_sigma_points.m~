function [sigma_points, w_m, w_c] = compute_sigma_points(mu, sigma, lambda, alpha, beta)
% This function samples 2n+1 sigma points from the distribution given by mu and sigma
% according to the unscented transform, where n is the dimensionality of mu.
% Each column of sigma_points should represent one sigma point
% i.e. sigma_points has a dimensionality of nx2n+1.
% The corresponding weights w_m and w_c of the points are computed using lambda, alpha, and beta:
% w_m = [w_m_0, ..., w_m_2n], w_c = [w_c_0, ..., w_c_2n] (i.e. each of size 1x2n+1)
% They are later used to recover the mean and covariance respectively.

w_m = zeros(1,2*n+1);
